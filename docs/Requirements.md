# Application Requirements

## üèóÔ∏è Functional Requirements

1. **Shortcut Management**
   - Users should be able to create, edit, and delete keyboard shortcuts.
   - Users should be able to assign key combinations to specific actions.

2. **Action Types**
   - Open a specific window or application.
   - Run a bash script.
   - Execute predefined system commands.

3. **User Interface**
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for managing shortcuts.
   - Display a list of all created shortcuts with their assigned key combinations and actions.
   - Allow users to test shortcuts directly from the interface.

4. **Configuration**
   - Save and load shortcut configurations.
   - Export and import shortcut configurations for backup and sharing.

## üîó Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - The application should respond quickly to user inputs.
   - Shortcuts should be executed with minimal delay.

2. **Security**
   - Ensure that running bash scripts does not compromise system security.

   - Ensure that shortcuts are reliably executed as configured.

## üî© Technical Requirements

1. **Frontend**
   - Use React for building the user interface.
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. **Backend**
   - Use Tauri for building the desktop application.
   - Implement shortcut handling and execution logic in Rust.

3. **Build and Deployment**
   - Provide scripts for building and packaging the application.
   - Ensure that the application can be easily installed and uninstalled.

## ‚öì Documentation
