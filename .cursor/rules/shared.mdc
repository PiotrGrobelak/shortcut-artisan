Prioritize error handling and edge cases
 - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
 - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
 - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
 - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
 - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
 - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
